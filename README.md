# React Portfolio Page

## Description

The motivation for this project was to make a react based portfolio page that can be viewed by companys.
I built this for the sole purpose of having acces to see the work I have done, be able to contact me, learn about me, and have a downloadable link to my resume.
This will solve a lot of problems with how my information is found, with this project everything to hire me can be found on one website as well how to contact me.
I learned how to make a website with virtual doms that can show different pages without leaving the url only changing the endpoint being seen.

## Credits 

I had help from my teacher, classmates, and tutor when needed.
